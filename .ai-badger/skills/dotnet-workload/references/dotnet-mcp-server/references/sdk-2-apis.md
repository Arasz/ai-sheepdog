## 7. MCP SDK 2.0 API specifics (verified against 2.0.0)

Facts below were verified by reflection on the installed `ModelContextProtocol.Core` 2.0.0
assembly and by reading the v2.0.0 sources (`AIFunctionMcpServerTool.cs`, `McpServerImpl.cs`,
`McpServerBuilderExtensions.cs`). Full notes + a reusable probe recipe:
`references/mcp-csharp-sdk-2.0-apis.md`.

**Backing the server with SQLite?** Prefer a self-managed database over loading
third-party native SQLite extensions: idempotent schema init, FTS5 external-content search,
sqlite-vec from NuGet, and the Dapper record-vs-class DTO traps are in
`references/managed-sqlite-store-patterns.md` — read it before designing the store layer.

### Prompts: `[McpServerPrompt]` + `WithPrompts<T>()`

2.0.0 adds attribute-based prompts, same shape as tools (class with methods, ctor injection works):

```csharp
internal sealed class MemoryPrompts
{
    [McpServerPrompt(Name = "memory-usage-guide")]   // else the name is the snake_cased method name
    [Description("Protocol for the calling agent: always pass project_id ...")]
    public string MemoryUsageGuide(
        [Description("The project id to scope memory operations to.")] string? projectId = null)
        => """...guide text...""";
}
```

- Register `.WithPrompts<MemoryPrompts>()` chained onto `AddMcpServer()` — works on both transports.
- **Return type is constrained**: `string` | `PromptMessage` | `IEnumerable<PromptMessage>` |
  `ChatMessage` | `IEnumerable<ChatMessage>`. ANY other return type throws
  `InvalidOperationException` at invoke time — returning `string` is the simple choice.
- `[McpServerPrompt(Name=…)]` overrides the derived name; `[Description]` on the method becomes
  the prompt description; `[Description]` on parameters becomes the agent-facing arg description.
- **Prompt copy is C# string content — watch the placeholders.** Inside an interpolated raw
  string (`$"""…"""`), `{project-id|*}` is parsed as an interpolation hole and fails to
  compile (CS1733 "Expected expression", CS9006 "does not start with enough '$' characters").
  Use `<project-id|*>` angle-bracket placeholders in prompt text (hit when adding watch-CLI
  examples to a guide).
- **Agent-facing prompts are the product, not boilerplate — design and pin them.** Review
  the distributed prompts for what a fresh agent actually needs: (1) a SEARCH-FIRST retrieval
  ladder — search the memory store first with 2-3 query formulations (exact phrase → keywords
  → plain-English restatement), escalate to the host's web/code search only by result
  (decisive hit → use and cite its source; partial → combine with one targeted external
  search; none → search externally, then write the finding back so the next lookup is
  answered from memory); (2) the full tool map with WHEN to use each (ingest/stats/sync
  included, not just search/write); (3) setup PREREQUISITES for CLI-configured features —
  e.g. the watch scope allowlist + enablement are CLI-only (`watch scope add` + `watch
  enable`), and `memory_watch_add` fails with `watching-disabled`/`path-outside-scope` until
  they exist, so the guide must say so. Pin the guide's load-bearing sentences with
  content-assertion tests (`guide.ShouldContain("memory_watch_add")`) — prompt copy is the
  agent contract and TDD applies to it like any behavior (2 new facts pinned a memory-first
  ladder + watch usage; the old guide said only "search before asking").

### Tool error signaling — the message-drop trap

`McpServerImpl` catches exceptions from tool invocation and returns `CallToolResult { IsError = true }` —
but `CreateToolCallErrorResult` includes the exception message in the error text **only when the
exception is `McpException`** (namespace `ModelContextProtocol`, ctor `(string message)`). A plain
`ArgumentException`/`InvalidOperationException` surfaces as the generic
`"An error occurred invoking '<tool>'."` with NO reason — useless for agent-facing coded errors
(spec-style `invalid-params: …`, `sync-not-configured`, …).

Two reliable options:
1. `throw new McpException("invalid-params: project_id is required");` — message preserved.
2. Return a structured error directly (the SDK has an explicit pass-through branch for it):

```csharp
private static CallToolResult Error(string message) => new()
{
    IsError = true,
    Content = [new TextContentBlock { Text = message }],
};
```

Option 2 literally "returns a structured tool error" and gives exact control of the text. Combined
with record success returns, the method returns `Task<object>` and the SDK's result switch dispatches
on the RUNTIME type (`CallToolResult` → pass-through honoring `IsError`; record → JSON text content +
structured content; `string` → `TextContentBlock`; `null` → empty content). The union pattern is
verified working — but keep the §6 `Task<object>`/`JsonElement` boxing caveat for tools that return
`JsonElement` directly.

### Request filters — per-tool-call interception (SDK 2.1.0)

`ModelContextProtocol.Server.McpRequestFilters` (verified by reflection probe on
the installed 2.1.0 assembly; the §7 2.0.0 notes predate it) exposes per-method
filter lists — the hook for activity signals (idle watchdog), auth, or per-call
logging without touching tool bodies or ASP.NET middleware: `ListToolsFilters`,
`CallToolFilters`, `CallToolWithAlternateFilters` (`IList<McpRequestFilter<TParams,TResult>>`).
Verified delegate shape (reflection probe, 2.1.0):
`McpRequestHandler<TParams,TResult> Invoke(McpRequestHandler<TParams,TResult>)` —
a filter is a WRAPPER/COMPOSER: given the next handler it returns a handler, so
registration is `filter => next => async (ctx, req, ct) => { …; return await
next(ctx, req, ct); }` (onion layers; the last filter's `next` is the real
dispatch). Contrast: `WithCallToolHandler(builder, handler)` REPLACES the default
dispatch — the SDK docs pair it with `WithListToolsHandler` to build a "complete
tools implementation" from scratch, so a custom CallTool handler must implement
dispatch itself (it does NOT chain onto `.WithTools<T>()`). Filters compose;
handlers replace. A `CallToolFilters` hook fires ONLY on `tools/call` — the
precise "any tool call" signal — whereas an ASP.NET middleware on `/mcp` sees every
request (initialize/list included) and keeps counting during long-lived connections.
Pick the filter when the signal must mean user tool traffic, middleware when any
protocol traffic counts.

### Tool name derivation

Method name → tool name: `Async` suffix stripped, then `JsonNamingPolicy.SnakeCaseLower`
(`MemoryWrite` → `memory_write`; `WriteAsync` → `write`). Pin the contract with
`[McpServerTool(Name = "…")]` so renames can't silently change the agent-facing name.

### Constructor injection (verified)

`WithTools<T>()`/`WithPrompts<T>()` register each method via
`McpServerTool.Create(method, r => CreateTarget(r.Services, typeof(T)), …)` where
`CreateTarget` = `ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance(services, type)` — the tool/prompt class is
constructed **per invocation** from DI. Any ctor dependency must be registered in `Program.cs`
(`AddSingleton<IMemoryStore, SqliteMemoryStore>()`, …); unit tests construct the class directly
(`NullLogger<T>.Instance` for `ILogger<T>` params).

### `WithToolsFromAssembly` ≠ `WithTools<T>()`

`WithToolsFromAssembly` only picks types marked `[McpServerToolType]`. Prefer explicit
`.WithTools<MemoryTools>()` — compile-checked, no extra attribute.

### Dual-transport shared DI

Both the stdio and HTTP branches of `Program.cs` need the same service registrations — extract a
top-level `static void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection)` local function and call it from both
branches (transport wiring stays per-branch). Pitfall: registering the SAME type twice with different
options (e.g. one `SqliteConnectionFactory` with `loadCloudSync: true` for sync, one without for the
store) — the LAST `AddSingleton<T>` wins for plain resolution; construct the special instance via a
factory lambda instead of relying on two registrations of one type.
