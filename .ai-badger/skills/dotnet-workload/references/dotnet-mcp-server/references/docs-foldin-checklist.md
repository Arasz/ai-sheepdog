## 13. Docs fold-in checklist

When shipping MCP tools alongside a feature, update these docs:

| Doc | What to add |
|---|---|
| `docs/functional-specification.md` §2 | New REST endpoint rows in the API table |
| `docs/functional-specification.md` §3 | New MCP tool names in the tool list; update tool count |
| `docs/features/README.md` | Mark feature dossier as `Shipped` |
| `docs/features/<feature>/requirements.md` | Update status line to `Shipped` |
| `docs/architecture.md` §5 | Extension-point table rows (if new interfaces added) |
| `docs/data-model.md` | New entities/records (if any) |
| `docs/flows.md` | New flow diagrams (if any) |

If architecture.md, data-model.md, and flows.md already have the content from a prior task, only update functional-specification.md and the status markers.
